# bitburner Scripts
 Just version controlling my gaming

 I am keeping track of the work as I play, ideally updating it at the end of every session with my progress.

 My priorities in order:

 Creating stable, future proof(ish) scripts
 Maximizing profit output

 I will always prioritize commiting time for high quality scripts than for the maximization of available resources.
